Shaam ko dekhna hi nahin, balki apne pyaar ke saath shaam ka nazara dekhna, yeh ek anokha aur dil ko choo lene wala ehsaas hai. Us samay, jaise saara jahan bas tum dono ke liye hi ruka ho.\n",
    "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\n",
